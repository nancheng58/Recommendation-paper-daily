Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation contexts.

This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics.

Specifically, we conducted a controlled study using a comprehensive e-commerce dataset containing various recommendation types, and collected Electroencephalography and behavioural data. We analysed both neural and behavioural responses to recommendations that were categorised as Exact, Substitute, Complement, or Irrelevant products within search query results.

By approximating the dot-product attention, linear attention provides an efficient option with linear complexity. However, existing linear attention methods face two limitations: 1) they often use learnable position encodings, which incur extra computational costs in long-term sequence scenarios, and 2) they may not consider the user's fine-grained local preferences and confuse these with the actual change of long-term interests. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model with Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first propose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to model long-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary position encodings. We then introduce a local short operation to incorporate local preferences and demonstrate the theoretical insight. We further introduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model determine whether a user's behavior indicates local interest or a genuine shift in long-term preferences.

However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.|[2506.13229](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13229)|**[link](https://github.com/zjlin2oo1/igd)**|\n", "2506.13021": "|**2025-06-16**|**C-TLSAN: Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network for Personalized Recommendation**|Siqi Liang et.al.|Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content associated with items, such as product descriptions.   C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization capacity of recommendation systems.   We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction history and predictions in text form.

This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems.|[2506.12756](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12756)|null|\n", "2506.12687": "|**2025-06-15**|**Device-Cloud Collaborative Correction for On-Device Recommendation**|Tianyu Zhan et.al.|With the rapid development of recommendation models and device computing power, device-based recommendation has become an important research area due to its better real-time performance and privacy protection.

Furthermore, to prevent SCN from overfitting, we design a global correction network (GCN) that processes hidden states uploaded from devices and provides a global correction solution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that CoCorrRec outperforms existing Transformer-based and RNN-based device recommendation models in terms of performance, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs, thereby achieving a balance between real-time performance and high efficiency.|[2506.12687](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12687)|null|\n", "2506.12540": "|**2025-06-14**|**Regulating Next-Generation Implantable Brain-Computer Interfaces: Recommendations for Ethical Development and Implementation**|Renee Sirbu et.al.|Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain.

To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for generative Recommendation. First, DiscRec introduces item-level position embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences. Second, DiscRec employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's ability to model sequential dependencies.

However, modern recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback. Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2) struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features in modern recommendation systems.

Unlike traditional techniques, generative AI not only learns patterns and representations from complex data but also enables content generation, data synthesis, and personalized experiences. This generative capability plays a crucial role in the field of recommendation systems, helping to address the issue of data sparsity and improving the overall performance of recommendation systems. Numerous studies on generative AI have already emerged in the field of recommendation systems. Meanwhile, the current requirements for recommendation systems have surpassed the single utility of accuracy, leading to a proliferation of multi-objective research that considers various goals in recommendation systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies on multi-objective recommendation systems based on generative AI technologies, leaving a significant gap in the literature. Therefore, we investigate the existing research on multi-objective recommendation systems involving generative AI to bridge this gap. We compile current research on multi-objective recommendation systems based on generative techniques, categorizing them by objectives. Additionally, we summarize relevant evaluation metrics and commonly used datasets, concluding with an analysis of the challenges and future directions in this domain.|[2506.16893](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16893)|null|\n", "2506.16683": "|**2025-06-20**|**A Simple Contrastive Framework Of Item Tokenization For Generative Recommendation**|Penglong Zhai et.al.|Generative retrieval-based recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments across public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various domains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative recommendation.|[2506.16683](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16683)|null|\n", "2506.16114": "|**2025-06-19**|**GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks**|Yejing Wang et.al.|Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem.

While computationally expensive, FHE can enable privacy-preserving neural inference in the client-server setting: a client encrypts their input with FHE and sends it to an untrusted server. The server then runs neural inference on the encrypted data and returns the encrypted results. The client decrypts the output locally, keeping both the input and result private from the server. Private inference has focused on networks with dense inputs such as image classification, and less attention has been given to networks with sparse features. Unlike dense inputs, sparse features require efficient encrypted lookup operations into large embedding tables, which present computational and memory constraints for FHE.   In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities when applying FHE to Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) from both a compiler and systems perspective. DLRMs utilize conventional MLPs for dense features and embedding tables to map sparse, categorical features to dense vector representations. We develop novel methods for performing compressed embedding lookups in order to reduce FHE computational costs while keeping the underlying model performant.

Each captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions, traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate needs.

Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.   To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example.

Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.   To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Experiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based on traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%.

By leveraging social connections and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently, influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task. However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of real-time group-item matching.   To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items. Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups.

A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code with suitable ones from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent.

A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation.|[2507.04626](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626)|null|\n", "2507.04623": "|**2025-07-07**|**Hierarchical Intent-guided Optimization with Pluggable LLM-Driven Semantics for Session-based Recommendation**|Jinpeng Chen et.al.|Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous session.

Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.

However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC).

Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users.

Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary relationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining these labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such relationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs attempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and unreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs) to infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary classification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels (FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user purchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a human-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that it covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then evaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could accurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated complementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that even with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve high macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as gpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy (0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as effective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents FBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more accurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.|[2507.03945](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03945)|null|\n", "2507.03789": "|**2025-07-04**|**Efficient and Effective Query Context-Aware Learning-to-Rank Model for Sequential Recommendation**|Andrii Dzhoha et.al.|Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models for next-item prediction.

Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable signals about user intent within a session.

Using four real-world POI datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare, Gowalla, and Yelp), we analyze the individual and combined effects of these approaches on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias.

Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical features.   In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \\textbf{LLM4Hint} that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model.

In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR models.

However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.   To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items).|[2507.03047](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047)|null|\n", "2507.06171": "|**2025-07-08**|**Data-Semantics-Aware Recommendation of Diverse Pivot Tables**|Whanhee Cho et.al.|Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.

We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.

To incorporate user history for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional diffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing items from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However, this design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets distracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation. This motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential recommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of noise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting point of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This formulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ history\" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion Recommendation (BBDRec).

This work explores parameter pruning to improve parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby enabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on inter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components such as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a more fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and layer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy that progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the model, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth. Each stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation techniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: across three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original model's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding parameters.

Existing domain grouping methods, based on business logic or data similarities, often fail to capture the true transfer relationships required for optimal grouping. To effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC models domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two distinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling non-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for considering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To integrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to calculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their contributions.

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities.

A major challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with repeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in distributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to scale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first demonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking qualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the substantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively expensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a non-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only during test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational overheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural knowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a plug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of various ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Accordingly, we propose a Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and recommendation performance.

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.   Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.|[2507.12871](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12871)|null|\n", "2507.12561": "|**2025-07-20**|**ROSE: Transformer-Based Refactoring Recommendation for Architectural Smells**|Samal Nursapa et.al.|Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability.

Despite the numerous research works in the area, several fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation methodologies.

Our results indicate that LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations. Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.

Adhering to these steps, we find that intra-news entity interest dominates the scanning stage, while the inter-news entity interest guides title reading and influences click decisions. Unfortunately, current methods overlook the unique utility of entities in news recommendation. To this end, we propose a novel method called IP2 to probe entity-guided reading interest at both intra- and inter-news levels. At the intra-news level, a Transformer-based entity encoder is devised to aggregate mentioned entities in the news title into one signature entity. Then, a signature entity-title contrastive pre-training is adopted to initialize entities with proper meanings using the news story context, which in the meantime facilitates us to probe for intra-news entity interest. As for the inter-news level, a dual tower user encoder is presented to capture inter-news reading interest from both the title meaning and entity sides. In addition to highlighting the contribution of inter-news entity guidance, a cross-tower attention link is adopted to calibrate title reading interest using inter-news entity interest, thus further aligning with real-world behavior.

In this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from other users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or data-limited applications.

However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed.

Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ hierarchical design following either cascading (e.g., view$\\rightarrow$cart$\\rightarrow$buy) or parallel (unified$\\rightarrow$behavior$\\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to capture behavioral relationships.

A fundamental assumption of multi-behavior recommendation methods is the existence of shared user preferences across behaviors, representing users' intrinsic interests. Based on this assumption, existing approaches aim to integrate information from various behaviors to enrich user representations. However, they often overlook the presence of both commonalities and individualities in users' multi-behavior preferences.

To address this issue, we propose a user invariant preference learning for multi-behavior recommendation (UIPL for short), aiming to capture users' intrinsic interests (referred to as invariant preferences) from multi-behavior interactions to mitigate the introduction of noise. Specifically, UIPL leverages the paradigm of invariant risk minimization to learn invariant preferences. To implement this, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract users' invariant preferences, replacing the standard reconstruction loss with an invariant risk minimization constraint. Additionally, we construct distinct environments by combining multi-behavior data to enhance robustness in learning these preferences. Finally, the learned invariant preferences are used to provide recommendations for the target behavior.

However, existing methods rarely explore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in the model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI categories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time information often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time interval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the continuity of time.

Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.|[2507.16253](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16253)|null|\n", "2507.16237": "|**2025-07-22**|**LLM-Enhanced Reranking for Complementary Product Recommendation**|Zekun Xu et.al.|Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.|[2507.16237](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16237)|null|\n"}, "LLM4rec": {}}
